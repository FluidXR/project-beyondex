## What is Project Beyondex?
Many of us upgrading from the Valve Index to the Bigscreen Beyond love the size and comfort, but find ourselves missing the incredible off-ear soundscape from the Index. 

That got us thinking. What if we could have both?

Project Beyondex is a mod we have designed for the Valve Index audio strap which makes its integrated audio compatible with the Bigscreen Beyond.

The mod involves removing the audio strap from the Index and flipping it "upside down", which allows the portion of the strap which cradled the back of the head to instead provide top-support for enhanced comfort. This kit is SUPER comfortable and packs both great sound and great visuals thanks to the micro-OLED screens and pancake optics of the Beyond. It's our favorite way to experience PCVR that we have experienced so far in our careers as VR devs.

We started from the original Firmware and DAC/AMP design of [Sctanf's Pico Amp project](https://github.com/sctanf/picoamp-2) and added a power supplementation system that allows us to drive the BMR drivers of the Index audio strap at full HD quality and volume from the output of the Beyond's usb port. Then we designed custom 3D model files for the connectors, enclosure, and top strap D-ring which when installed on the Index audio strap and Beyond, turn it into something that feels like it is a fully-integrated whole and more than just a modded headset.

Note: We spent a lot of time and money developing the 3D models in this project. You are free to use these models for yourself, but you may not use them commercially or sell prints of these online. If you remix, repost, or modify these files or models, you must do so under the same non-commercial license in this repo and point back to this repo and license. If you want to make your own Beyondex-like project under a different licencse for commercial use, you can start from Sctanf's project's files, which have licenses that are more permissive.

Sctanf's Pico Amp PCB schematics and firmware are licensed under MIT license (firmware) and CERN OHL v2 license (hardware).
